# Sportsee - Front-end

This repo contains all the source code to run the sports analytics SportSee front-end.

## Project

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 2. Launching the project

- Fork and run first the Sportsee dashboard on [https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard), on port [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Fork this repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- The `yarn` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `yarn start` command will allow you to run the Sportsee app front-end.

**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked from ``mocks/mock-data.js`` in this front-end repository and then from the front-end Dashboard. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

### 3. Available Scripts

You can run Sportsee front-end in this project with :

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. \

Open the default port chosen by React to view it in your browser ( the default port will be 3001 or other, because port 3000 is already used by the dashboard) .

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
